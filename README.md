# Matrix_Operations_and_FizzBuzzGame

# Fizz Buzz:

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word “buzz". Fizz buzz has been widely used as an interview screening device for computer programmers.

# Problem Statement:

Print the numbers 1..100
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number
For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

For this part of the work I write two versions of FizzBuzz in Java;

1) First I implement the function described above in Java named fizzBuzz()
2) Then an extended version called optimusPrime() that still applies the fizzBuzz rules but also has two additional rules;

For primary numbers print “Prime” instead of the number.

For the conjunction of these rules (both prime and a multiply of 3 or 5) print “OptimusPrime” instead of the number. (Hint: there are only two of them)

fizzBuzz Example: [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...] = [ 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, ...]
optimusPrime Example: [ 1, 2, 3, ...] = [ 1, Prime, OptimusPrime, 4, OptimusPrime, Fizz, ...]

# 2. Matrices
A matrix is a set or group of numbers arranged in a square or rectangular array enclosed by two brackets. A matrix can also be represented as a 2D array. You are asked to write a class for matrix operations in Java that consists of constructors, getters, setters and some operations specified below. You can assume that the matrices’ dimensions will be compatible for operations such as addition, multiplication and subtraction, meaning you do not have to worry about errors involving illegal matrix dimensions
